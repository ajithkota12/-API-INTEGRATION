DESCRIPTION : 

📌 Project Overview
The Weather App is a real-time weather information platform that allows users to check the current weather conditions of different cities. This web application is developed using React.js and fetches live weather data from the OpenWeather API. It displays essential weather details such as temperature, wind speed, weather description, and the current date & time. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to enter a city name and instantly retrieve weather data.

This project primarily focuses on API integration, state management in React, and UI responsiveness using CSS. The application dynamically updates the weather information upon user input and ensures a smooth user experience with real-time data fetching.

🎯 Features Implemented
🔄 Live Weather Updates

The app retrieves real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API whenever a user searches for a city.

The API response includes weather conditions, temperature, and wind speed.

🔍 City-Based Search

Users can enter the name of any city in the search bar to get weather details.

The app processes the input dynamically and fetches data from the API.

🕒 Real-Time Date and Time Display

The app uses Moment.js to display the current date and time dynamically.

The date updates automatically, ensuring accurate weather information.

🎨 Simple and Clean UI

Designed with CSS to create an appealing and user-friendly interface.

The app uses Google Fonts, Animate.css, and FontAwesome for enhanced styling.

📶 API Integration with Fetch

Weather data is retrieved using the fetch() method in JavaScript.

The app processes the API response and dynamically updates the UI.

🚨 Error Handling for Invalid Inputs

If a user enters an invalid city name, an error message is displayed.

The app ensures that users receive feedback when a location is not found.

📱 Responsive Design

The app is designed to be fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Uses @media queries in CSS for mobile-friendly design.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React.js

Data Fetching: Fetch API

State Management: React useState Hook

Styling: CSS, Google Fonts, FontAwesome, Animate.css

Date & Time Formatting: Moment.js

API Used: OpenWeather API

📌 How It Works
User Input Handling:

The user enters a city name in the text box and clicks the "Get Weather" button.

Fetching Data from API:

The app makes a request to the OpenWeather API using the fetch() method.

The API responds with weather information such as temperature, weather condition, and wind speed.

Displaying Weather Information:

The app dynamically updates the UI to show:

City Name

Current Date & Time

Temperature (°C)

Weather Description (e.g., "Cloudy", "Sunny")

Wind Speed (m/s)

Weather Icon

Error Handling:

If the city name is invalid or the API request fails, the app displays an error message.

🛠 Code Structure
index.js (Entry Point)

Renders the App component into the root div.

Imports index.css for styling.

App.js (Main Component)

Wraps the Weather component.

Displays the application header.

Weather.js (Weather Fetching & Display)

Handles API requests using fetch().

Uses useState for managing city input and weather data.

Displays weather details dynamically.

index.css (Styling)

Defines the layout, input fields, buttons, and weather display styling.

🚀 Challenges Faced & Solutions
🔄 Handling API Response Delay

Implemented an error message for failed API requests.

🎨 UI Design & Responsiveness

Used CSS Flexbox and Google Fonts for better UI.

🌍 Making the App More Dynamic
